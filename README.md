# ASCII-Smuggling-Hidden-Prompt-Injection-Demo
ASCII Smuggling Hidden Prompt Injection is a novel approach to hacking AI assistants using Unicode Tags. This project demostrate how to use Unicode Tags to hide prompt injection instruction to bypass security measures and inject prompts into large language models, such as GPT-4, leading them to provide unintended or harmful responses.
